# Sudoku Solver
This began as a simple Java program to solve sudokus.

It later became a project in my Web Programming class where I ported Java to Javascript with an HTML frontend.

Now it is a practical example for porting programs to other languages.

It goes hand-in-hand with the Code-Examples repo: as I learn new languages, this is a fairly robust project to try those languages on.

One day I want to use this as a means to learn GUI applications in languages other than Java and HTML.
